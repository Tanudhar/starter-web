NEW DELHI:  In the middle of a raging political row over the Rafale deal, former French president Francois Hollande 
has been quoted as telling a website that the Indian government had proposed Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as India
partner in the 36-fighter jet deal and that France had not been given a choice. Denying the charge, a defence 
ministry spokesperson tweeted that the report "is being verified" and that "neither GoI (government of India) 
nor the French Government had any say in the commercial decision." Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who has been 
attacking the PM over the Rafale deal, tweeted to say "the PM has betrayed India".
